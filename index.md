# Mr. Infinity Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 20, 2021

By default, Mr. Infinity does not store any data. When you start setting up your bot, it always saves that setting (room id, boolean, role id). The bot only saves the server settings, nothing more.

Alternatively, if you want to delete this data, just kick the bot from the server, or contact me at [Mr. Infinity's Support server](https://discord.gg/khcPATUvwg).

Also see [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
